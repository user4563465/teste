Cut off my wings and come lock me up
Just pull the plug, yeah, I've had enough
Tear me to pieces, sell me for parts
You're all vampires, so here, you can have my heart
You can have my heart
You can have my heart

The world's a funeral, a room of ghosts
No hint of movement, no sign of pulse
Only an echo, just skin and bone
They kicked the chair, but we, we helped tie the rope
You can have my heart
You can have my heart

So come rain on my parade, 'cause I wanna feel it
Come shove me over the edge, 'cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry, but it's too late, and it's not worth saving
So come rain on my parade
I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed, and now there's no way back

You must've made some kind of mistake
I asked for death, but instead I'm awake
The Devil told me, "no room for cheats"
I thought I'd sold my soul, but he kept the receipt
So leave a light on, I'm coming home
It's getting darker, but I'll carry on
The sun don't shine, but it never did
And when it rains, it fucking pours, but I think I like it
And you know that I'm in love with the mess, I think I like it
Sing it!

So come rain on my parade, 'cause I wanna feel it
Come shove me over the edge, 'cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry, but it's too late, and it's not worth saving
So come rain on my parade
I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed, and now there's no way back
I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed, and now there's no way back
As loud as you can!
So come rain on my parade, 'cause I wanna feel it
Come shove me over the edge, 'cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry, but it's too late, and it's not worth saving
So come rain on my parade
